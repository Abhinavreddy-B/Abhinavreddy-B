*Since the websites were hosted on free service of render.com, a few times the first api call might be slow.  

render.com: Our free tier does spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, so the first request after the service is spun down may take a while, but subsequent requests should be faster.More info related to this here: https://render.com/docs/free
